# Brainfunk

## Description

A simple JavaScript Brainfuck interpreter with breakpoint support.

2012, Jean-Karim Bockstael <jkb@jkbockstael.be>

## How to use

Brainfunk is a simple implentation of the brainfuck programming langage. I have added a basic breakpoint support for debug purpose, just insert `@` characters in the code where you want program execution to halt.

The source code should be clear enough for anyone to understand and modify, if it's not then feel free to PR me any improvement :)

Enjoy!
